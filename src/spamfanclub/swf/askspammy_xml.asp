			<question><![CDATA[<b>Dear SPAMMY,</b><br><br>How does the internet work? And what's the difference between internet spam and SPAM?<br><br><i>Snipplebits@hotmail.com</i>]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[<b>SPAMMY Sez,</b><br><br>Dearest Snipplebits, the Internet is an enormous web of wires and pocket protectors that has slowly spread across the entire world. It was developed in 1973 as a way to connect science laboratories and universities. And probably the Pentagon was involved. They eat a lot of SPAM there because it's a military place and stuff. <br><br>Now in response to your second question, internet spam is a horrible thing. I don't know how it got the same name as our beloved meaty friend, but I think it's a travesty and it makes me ever so mad. Steaming mad. Email spam has been defined as "An unsolicited e-mail message sent to many recipients at one time, or a news article posted simultaneously to many newsgroups." What that has to do with a delicious miracle treat enjoyed by millions is beyond me. Maybe this internet thing is getting out of control. Just kidding. ]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[<b>Dear SPAMMY,</b><br><br>What's the best music to eat SPAM to? <br><br><i>Joseph</i>]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[Joseph, my friend, this has to be one of the most difficult questions I've had to deal with. The truth is, there is no right answer.  Some may enjoy good old gangsta rap while enjoying their SPAM sandwich. I've often blasted marching music while having a nice breakfast of SPAM and eggs. Maybe circus music when you devour some award-winning SPAM cupcakes. See folks? SPAM is so musically versatile. Is there no end to the possibilities?]]></answer>

			<question><![CDATA[<b>Dear SPAMMY,</b><br><br>How much fat is in a can of SPAM? <br><br><i>Kristy from Mobridge, SD</i>]]></question>
			<answer><![CDATA[<b>Oh Kristy,</b><br><br>There are lot of people out there who are very concerned about their fat intake. SPAMMY understands. You want to eat healthy and look your best. SPAMMY appreciates this, believe me. OK, here's the facts. SPAM has 16 grams of fat per serving. Is that a lot? I'm not a dietician. Then there is SPAM Oven Roasted Turkey (that's the official name for it) with only 4 grams of fat per serving, and SPAM Lite with 8 grams of fat per serving. It's all right on the label, people.]]></answer>
